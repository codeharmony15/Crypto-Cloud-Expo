The logo should be in the top left corner, also add the word Crypto Cloud Expo to the logo in pixel font. The site should preferably be designed not in bright colors, if possible limit yourself to 3 colors that will complement each other (for example, black, white, yellow). The rest of the fonts should be consistent with each other. Do not be afraid to be creative in the design. Combine fonts to make them look presentable
